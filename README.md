Project Name: 922Platform - Senior Project

Overview:
Welcome to our Senior Project repository! Here, we present the culmination of our academic journey the 922 Platform. 
This project represents the dedication and hard work of our team towards addressing a significant societal need: efficient management of less critical reports to optimize emergency response resources.

Objective:
As part of our Senior Project, our primary goal is to develop a user-friendly, confidential, 
and efficient online platform for handling less critical reports that cannot be managed through traditional emergency services like 911. 
By focusing on optimizing resource utilization and enhancing public satisfaction, we aim to contribute positively to our community's safety and well-being.
